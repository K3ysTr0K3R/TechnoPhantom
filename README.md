If you love web-crawling then this is the right tool for you. It can crawl, videos, images, CSS files, login pages(admin panels), PDF documents and more.
This script is converted into a binary executable so you can store the script into your '/usr/local/bin' directory if you want.
Or run the 'store_technophantom.sh' to store it for you, if you dont know that is.
