If you have a passion for web-crawling, then look no further, as this tool is precisely what you need. It possesses the ability to crawl various types of content such as videos, images, CSS files, login pages (admin panels), PDF documents, and much more. What sets this script apart is its conversion into a binary executable, allowing you to conveniently store it in your '/usr/local/bin' directory. Alternatively, you can utilize the 'store_technophantom.sh' script to handle the storage process for you, in case you're unfamiliar with the procedure.
